[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions use
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.8.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Delivery lifecycle** (admin-only): per-gallery state `proofing → retouching → delivered`
  with a timeline of milestones (created, first view, first selection, state changes, notes).
  New `gallery_events` table + `galleries.delivery_state` column.
- **Engagement analytics**: per-gallery **Insights** tab — 30-day view trend, unique visitors,
  viewers→selectors conversion, and a per-photo views/downloads/likes table. Admin home gains
  totals tiles (views, unique visitors, downloads, selections).
- Owner **admin quick-link** on the public homepage (already present on gallery/portfolio pages).

## [1.7.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Mobile client-gallery toolbar redesigned — primary action visible, the rest in a collapsible
  menu (replaces the cramped horizontal scroll).
- Public gallery routes now return a proper **HTTP 404** for missing galleries (removed the
  `loading.tsx` Suspense boundary that was flushing a 200 shell before `notFound()`).

## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Responsive image pipeline**: new 1280px `md` derivative, `srcset`/`sizes` on grids, lightbox
  and hero; immutable long-cache for versioned image URLs; on-demand lazy generation + a backfill
  script for existing photos.
- Branded **404 / error / global-error** pages and loading skeletons.
- **Premium client experience**: branded locked-gallery gate (blur-placeholder cover), cookie→
  welcome overlay sequencing, admin gallery-list thumbnails, homepage hero empty-state.
- Polished admin **login** page.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-17

### Changed
- Admin **settings** reorganized into tabs (General · Security · Gallery defaults · Sharing).
- Gallery admin reorganized into tabs (Photos · Settings · Comments · Collaborators).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Per-gallery collaborators** — invite/onboard via passkey, scoped upload/organize
  capabilities, owner-only management, audit actor tracking.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Event self-service** — bib-number OCR search, batch face search, public event page
  (all-WASM ML, no native build).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Delivery/download**: multi-resolution downloads, RAW original delivery, forensic watermark.
- Server-side admin sessions (revocable) and cookie-consent handling.

### Fixed
- Default download is lossless (surgical GPS-only strip) instead of a lossy re-encode.

## [1.2.x] — 2026-07-15

### Changed
- Project renamed to **Albm**.

### Added
- Selectable album-preview / cover-photo pickers, shift-click range selection, and a batch of
  quality-of-life admin improvements.

  downloads, watermarks, sections, comments, EXIF (GPS excluded), event pages, PWA, passkey admin.
